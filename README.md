# homework-your-choice
Java program that utilizes the two review topics I requested

## Requested Topics
The two topics I chose are:
- Lists
- Maps

This is because they are commonly used in coding when working with large data sets and I'm a bit rusty on their implementation. The homework and in-class assignments have been helpful though, so I figured choosing these topics for this particular assignment would be a great way to continue working on them.

## Topic Implementation
I'm going to create an empty array list that will have data entered into it by a user. This list will then be fed into a map that will output if there are any duplicate words. The user will also be able to choose an index from the list and the program will output what word is currently in that index.

## Future Implementation
- Account for user error such as trying to enter integers as strings
- Account for capital vs non-capital letters
- Add methods so that 'Main' isn't so bloated
